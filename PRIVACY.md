# Privacy Policy

Tabhunter saves the following data in local storage:

* search-pattern
* show-audio checkbox
* whether to hide discarded tabs
* whether to close on the go button
* the preferences

That's it. Tabhunter doesn't save anything else, and doesn't
communicate any data to other machines.  With the only exception that
if you have somehow mapped the volume containing your local-storage
directory to another machine, that data will be transmitted remotely.
