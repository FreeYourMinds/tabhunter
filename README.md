# Tabhunter (the WebExtensions version)

## Help wade through all your tabs

## Based on the much-loved, classic Firefox extension

This extension lets you easily juggle dozens of tabs at any time. Enter a
search string (actually a standard JavaScript regex), highlight
the URL you want to bring up, and press return or double-click it.
Tabhunter will even bring up minimized windows containing the desired tab.

Inspired by Davide Ficano's tab selector extension for ActiveState's
Komodo IDE, and my own need for some assistance in managing my
web-based workload. Not to be confused by the actor from the '50s
and '60s, known by some as 'Tab "Space" Hunter' to avoid any
ambiguity. Note the proper spelling of this add-on is "Tabhunter"
with a capital T, lower-case h.
